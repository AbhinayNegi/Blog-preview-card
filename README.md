## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS

### What I learned

- I learned about how to center an element horizontally and vertically by using position: fixed; then top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
- Using top left value move the element relative to the viewport and it starts counting the distance from the edge of the element.
- If we enter value in percentage for translate function it will move element based on its size
- If we enter value in pixel for translate function it will then move element based on pixel values.
- transform function starts calulating position from the middle of the element and not from its edges.
- Providing negative value for transform function will move element in opposite direction
- Using :hover we can add style to element whenever user hover overs to a particular element.


### Continued development

I will learn and understand further on layouts, transform and position
