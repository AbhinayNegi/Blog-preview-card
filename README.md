## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS

### What I learned

- I learned about how to center an element horizontally and vertically by using position: fixed; then top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
- Using the top left value move the element relative to the viewport and it starts counting the distance from the edge of the element.
- If we enter a value in percentage for the translate function it will move the element based on its size
- If we enter a value in pixel for the translate function it will then move the element based on pixel values.
- The transform function starts calculating position from the middle of the element and not from its edges.
- Providing a negative value for the transform function will move an element in the opposite direction
- Using :hover we can add style to an element whenever the user hovers over to a particular element.


### Continued development

I will learn and understand further layouts, transform, and position
